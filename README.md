# DiscordTokensFormatter

A small script to convert the `email:password:token` format to the `token` format for Discord tokens.

- Enter your tokens (email:password:token) in the tokens.txt file
- Launch the Start.bat file if you are on windows, else launch the formatter.py file with a command line
- Your tokens should be exported in the result.txt file
